# üåê Hybrid Azure Infrastructure Lab: AD + Monitoring + Azure Integration

This project simulates a real-world hybrid IT infrastructure by integrating on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD). It demonstrates identity federation, GPO enforcement, Azure VM monitoring, secure backup, and delegated Azure access ‚Äî built as a proof-of-concept for enterprise hybrid setups.

---

## ‚úÖ Project Overview

- Windows Server VM provisioned via **Terraform**
- AD DS promoted to **Domain Controller (corp.local)**
- **GPOs** created and scoped to OU-specific policy requirements
- Azure AD (Entra ID) **hybrid identity sync** with scoped OU
- **Azure Monitor** and **Azure Backup** configured for observability and protection
- One synced user granted delegated access to Azure resources

---

## üîß Infrastructure Deployment via Terraform

The base infrastructure (VM, networking) was provisioned using Terraform. The `.tfvars` file was **excluded from GitHub** using `.gitignore` as it contains sensitive values (e.g., admin credentials, region, names). This file allows customization without changing core `.tf` files.

> Example usage:
```bash
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

---

## üß± Domain Controller Setup

After deploying the VM:

1. Installed the **Active Directory Domain Services** (AD DS) role.
2. Promoted the VM to a **Domain Controller** with the domain `corp.local`.

## üè¢ Organizational Units & GPO Configuration

Created the following Organizational Units (OUs):

- `IT`
- `HR`
- `Finance`
- `Azure Users` (created later for hybrid identity)

GPOs were assigned based on department policies:

- **HR & Finance** received a policy to disable CMD prompt.
- **IT** was granted **Local Administrator** access via GPO.

**GPO Overview:**

**Lockdown CMD Prompt (HR/Finance):**

**Local Admin Access (IT):**

## üß™ GPO Testing & User Access

To confirm GPO enforcement:

- Logged in as a restricted user from `HR` OU.
- Confirmed **Command Prompt was disabled**.
- Verified `IT` users had admin privileges.

**CMD Locked for HR User:**

**Admin Access for IT (Policy Applied):**  
> *Verified through login + access testing, screenshots not shown.*

## üß™ GPO & Admin Lockout Avoidance

While securing GPOs for lockdown, care was taken to **add the `labadmin` account to the local administrators group**. This prevented accidental lockout from the VM during restrictive GPO testing.

## üîÅ Hybrid Identity Sync (Azure AD Connect)

To simulate a real-world hybrid identity setup, I configured Microsoft Entra Connect to synchronize a specific organizational unit (OU) from on-premises Active Directory into Azure AD. This approach follows enterprise practices where only selected users ‚Äî such as IT staff or cloud-enabled roles ‚Äî are synced to Azure.

Since the on-prem domain was `corp.local` (non-routable), I added a **new UPN suffix** `harveyaland99outlook.onmicrosoft.com` to support Azure sign-in. This matches the default Azure tenant domain.

To align with how many enterprises segment Azure-integrated users, I created a **dedicated OU named `Azure Users`**, where only select identities would be synchronized. This made testing and permission management easier and avoided syncing unnecessary or system accounts.

I also created a user called `az_Harvey.Smith`, intended to act as the IT administrator for Azure. The UPN was set to `az_harveysmith@harveyaland99outlook.onmicrosoft.com`, slightly adjusted from the AD name to be compliant with Azure formatting (e.g. no underscores in Azure UPNs).

Once the user and OU were ready, I scoped Azure AD Connect to sync **only the `Azure Users` OU** and ran a manual sync.

> ‚ùó **Troubleshooting:**  
> On the first sync attempt, the user synced to Azure AD but could not sign in due to a password hash synchronization issue. To resolve this, I restarted the sync service and reconfigured Entra Connect. The issue was resolved on the second sync.

## üë§ Azure Portal Access (Synced User)

Once synced:

- The user was visible in Azure AD.
- Assigned the `Contributor` role.
- Logged into the **Azure Portal** successfully.
- Verified Azure console access for Harvey Smith.

**Azure AD Presence Confirmed:**

**Role Assignment:**

**Login Confirmation:**

**Azure Access Confirmed:**

> ‚úÖ **Note**: A custom OU helped enforce separation of synced users. Azure user login was validated and tested end-to-end.

## üìä Monitoring the VM (Azure Monitor)

1. Created a new **Log Analytics workspace**
2. Set up a **data collection rule** for guest metrics
3. Linked VM to Insights and verified performance visibility

**Workspace Created:**

**Data Collection Rule:**

**CPU Utilization:**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you only see a flatline, ensure the agent is installed and configured properly. Initial delay is normal post-activation.

---

## üíæ Azure Backup Configuration

1. Created a **Recovery Services Vault**
2. Applied the **Enhanced backup policy** with daily snapshot retention
3. Enabled protection for the VM

**Backup Setup:**

- Securely scoped **hybrid identity**
- Delegated Azure access via synced AD accounts
- Automated **monitoring** and **backup**

Designed for **infrastructure engineers**, this lab reflects practical scenarios in hybrid environments with Terraform-based provisioning, minimal cost, and extensibility for DR or role-based access in future iterations.
